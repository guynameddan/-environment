# Sample Apps

This is a sample repository made as part of [*The Ruby On Rails Tutorial*](https://www.railstutorial.org), possibly the greatest
beginner ruby on rails tutorial in the history of the Universe. You should totally [
check it out](https://www.railstutorial.org), and be sure to [join
the email list](http://learnenough.com/#email_list) and [follow @learnenough
](http://twitter.com/learnenough) on Twitter.

After finishing *The Ruby On Rails Tutorial*, you'll know enough ruby on rails
to be *dangerous*. This means you'll be able to use Rails to build an app from rails.
